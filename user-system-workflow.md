# User System Workflow: LLM Agent Creation & Deployment

## Overview

This document outlines the end-to-end user workflow for creating, testing, and deploying custom AI agents using the AWS LLM Continuous Training & Deployment Platform.

## Workflow Stages

### 1. Base Model Selection
- User accesses the "Model Registry" screen
- Browses available foundation models
- Filters by size, capabilities, and performance metrics
- Selects appropriate base model for customization
- System prepares model for customization process

### 2. Data Ingestion & Processing
- User navigates to "Data Management" screen
- Uploads company data in various formats:
  - Documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
  - Structured data (CSV, JSON, XML)
  - Images (JPG, PNG) with metadata
  - Database exports
- System analyzes uploaded files:
  - Identifies file types automatically
  - Extracts text from documents
  - Processes tabular data
  - Extracts text from images using OCR
- System creates metadata catalog of all ingested content
- User reviews extracted data for quality and coverage

### 3. Data Embedding & Understanding
- System processes all extracted content:
  - Generates embeddings for all text content
  - Creates vector representations of data
  - Builds knowledge graphs for relationships
  - Tags and categorizes content
- User monitors processing progress
- System provides statistics on processed data:
  - Volume of embedded content
  - Entity recognition results
  - Topic clustering visualization
  - Potential knowledge gaps

### 4. Agent Creation & Configuration
- User navigates to "Agent Builder" screen
- Defines agent purpose and capabilities:
  - Sets primary functions and use cases
  - Configures personality and tone
  - Defines knowledge domain boundaries
  - Sets safety guardrails
- Creates agent instructions:
  - Drafts system prompts
  - Sets behavioral guidelines
  - Configures response formats
  - Implements custom functions
- Links agent to processed data sources
- Sets permission levels and access controls

### 5. Agent Testing & Validation
- User accesses "Testing" screen
- Conducts interactive testing:
  - Direct conversation testing
  - Scenario simulation
  - Edge case exploration
- Selects standard benchmarks to run:
  - Knowledge accuracy tests
  - Reasoning capability tests
  - Safety and compliance tests
  - Performance and latency tests

### 6. Custom Benchmark Creation
- User navigates to "Custom Benchmarks" screen
- Creates company-specific test suites:
  - Imports expected Q&A pairs
  - Defines success criteria
  - Sets performance thresholds
  - Configures test frequency
- Builds specialized evaluation metrics
- Links benchmarks to specific data sources
- Saves benchmark for continuous testing

### 7. Comprehensive Agent Evaluation
- System runs all configured tests and benchmarks
- Generates detailed performance reports:
  - Standard benchmark scores
  - Custom benchmark results
  - Knowledge gap analysis
  - Accuracy and precision metrics
  - Latency and resource usage statistics
- User reviews results and makes adjustments
- System provides improvement recommendations

### 8. Deployment Configuration
- User accesses "Deployment" screen
- Configures deployment parameters:
  - Selects AWS region
  - Chooses instance types
  - Sets scaling parameters
  - Configures endpoint security
- Defines monitoring and alerting rules:
  - Performance thresholds
  - Error rate monitoring
  - Usage pattern alerting
  - Cost management controls
- Sets up logging and analytics
- Reviews and confirms configuration

### 9. AWS Deployment & Monitoring
- System deploys agent to AWS infrastructure:
  - Provisions required resources
  - Deploys model artifacts
  - Configures API endpoints
  - Sets up monitoring systems
- User receives deployment confirmation
- Accesses monitoring dashboard:
  - Real-time performance metrics
  - Usage statistics
  - Error tracking
  - Cost analysis
- Sets up continuous improvement cycle:
  - Scheduled re-evaluations
  - Feedback collection mechanisms
  - Data refresh processes
  - Version update planning
