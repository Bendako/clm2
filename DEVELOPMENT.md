# LLM Continuous Training & Deployment Platform: Development Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for developing the LLM Continuous Training & Deployment Platform from start to finish. The platform enables companies to customize, continuously train, and deploy language models according to their specific needs. Our development approach will focus on first building a complete local version of the system before integrating with AWS infrastructure.

## 7. Getting Started with Implementation

To begin implementing the platform:

1. Start with setting up the local development environment as described in section 1
2. Implement the infrastructure abstraction interfaces first
3. Build the core UI components and backend services
4. Develop the model registry with local storage
5. Implement the local training and deployment pipeline
6. Add benchmarking and monitoring capabilities
7. Focus on AWS integration after the local system is fully functional
8. Expand features according to the development phases outlined above

## 8. Documentation

Maintain documentation for:
- API endpoints
- Database schema
- Provider interfaces
- AWS resources (when integrated)
- User workflows
- Development processes
- Deployment procedures

Keep the documentation up-to-date as the project evolves to ensure seamless development and onboarding of new team members.

This development guide provides a comprehensive roadmap for building the LLM Continuous Training & Deployment Platform first as a local system and then integrating it with AWS. This approach allows for faster development cycles during the initial phases and a smooth transition to cloud infrastructure when the core functionality is stable.
