# Understanding the Platform

## Platform Goals

*   Allow companies to customize language models according to their specific needs
*   Run tests against standardized benchmarks to ensure model quality
*   Create and use custom benchmarks specific to the company
*   Support continuous retraining when new information becomes available
*   Deploy and manage these models in AWS

## How to Develop It

### 1. Technical Components Needed:

*   Frontend: A web application with dashboards for monitoring, configuration, and control
*   Backend Services: APIs to handle model training, testing, deployment
*   AWS Integration: Services to deploy models to AWS infrastructure
*   Database: To store model versions, benchmarks, and test results
*   Continuous Training Pipeline: Automated workflows for retraining models

### 2. Key Functionality to Implement:

*   Model Customization: Interface for uploading custom data and configuring fine-tuning
*   Benchmark Management: Creating, editing, and managing benchmark tests
*   Version Control: Tracking model versions and their performance
*   Deployment Controls: Configuring where and how models are deployed
*   Performance Monitoring: Dashboards showing model performance over time
*   Rollback Capability: Ability to revert to previous versions if needed
